# Gridbot
Gridbot was made in early 2019 for my final project of high school. The project was to create a robot that was able to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against a human opponent. The robot consisted of an arm with an attached magnet that could move on a 2d grid. The robot was powered by the code in this repository written in C++ ran on a Raspberry Pi 3. The code is quite messy as it was my first project written in C++. In the end the project was given a perfect score and it won the school prize for best final project.
